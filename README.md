# Numerical Analysis
## Implementation of different Numerical analysis methods
Each project includes 
- Project_review.pdf file which contains a detailed project review (Problem formulation, mathematical part of a problem, program implementation description)
- to_gnuplot.txt file which may be loaded into gnuplot to obtain the plots from Project review
- results.txt file which contains numerical results confirming that implementation is correct
